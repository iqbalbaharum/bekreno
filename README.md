(If you are new to Mac OS, you can follow this installation step by step.)

###Cloning repository into local folder.

1. Install Homebrew (recommended) into your Mac OS (refer to this link : https://brew.sh)
2. Now, you need to download Git bash with Homebrew. Simply by running this command in your terminal : 

``````````````````
$ brew install git
``````````````````

3. To clone, run this command on your terminal : 

``````````````````````````````````````````````
cd [folder_name] - set directory folder
git clone [copied repository url from git hub]
``````````````````````````````````````````````

4. The file that you cloned should be in the local folder.

## Database

Database: MySQL

The model is built with SQL-query in mind. To change it, u need to update the datasource.

## Database Migration

Database migration is a process to migrate models to database tables or collections.
When a migration is finished, the dataset in the source databases resides in target databases.

Auto-migration helps the user create relational database schemas based on definitions of their models together with their relation.

**Reference**
https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Database-migrations.html

**Create a new migration**

1. Create models
2. Create repository
3. Add model in `migrate.ts`

**Run migration**

```
npm run build
npm run migrate
```

## File Storage

To reduce system complexity, the framework use cloud-based storage.

**Reference**
[Loopback-storage-components](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Storage-component.html)

#### Using Cloud provider (AWS)

1. Go to [file.datasource.ts](), and **change** code for `const config` to below

```js
const config = {
  name: 'File',
  connector: 'loopback-component-storage',
  provider: 'aws',
  key: <AWS_KEY>,
  keyId: <AWS_KEY_PROVIDER>,
  nameConflict: 'makeUnique',
  makeUnique: true,
};
```

To get AWS_KEY you'll will need to register and go to [AWS Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html)

#### Using Filesystem

To change to to local storage follow step belows:

1. In root, create a new folder named `storage`
2. Change directory inside `./storage` and create another folder name similar as **STORAGE CONTAINER**
3. Go to [file.datasource.ts](), and **change** code for `const config` to below

```js
const config = {
  name: 'File',
  connector: 'loopback-component-storage',
  provider: 'filesystem',
  root: './storage',
};
```

4. Run application
